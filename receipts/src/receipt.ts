 * replay input, and decision — NO payloads, NO PII — plus jurisdiction, risk
 * tier, suite, and timestamp, signed with the suite's PQ signature (ML-DSA-87).
 * The receipt body is the leaf appended to the transparency log, so anyone can
 * verify the signature (with the issuer key) AND log inclusion (against a
 * gossiped root) WITHOUT trusting the log operator or the issuer's honesty.
 *
 * The intent commitment is SALTED so it is HIDING, not merely binding (RCPT‑001,
 * Team Apex 2026‑06‑21; ADR‑0014): a high‑entropy per‑receipt salt is folded into
 * `commitments.intent` so a low‑entropy field (e.g. `amount`) cannot be
 * brute‑forced from the PUBLIC leaf. The salt is carried on the `Receipt` wrapper
 * (`intentSalt`) and is DELIBERATELY NOT part of `ReceiptBody` / the leaf; it is
 * revealed only to authorized verifiers for selective disclosure.
