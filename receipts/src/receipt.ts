 * Team Apex 2026‑06‑21; ADR‑0014): a high‑entropy per‑receipt salt is folded into
 * `commitments.intent` so a low‑entropy field (e.g. `amount`) cannot be
 * brute‑forced from the PUBLIC leaf. The salt is carried on the `Receipt` wrapper
 * (`intentSalt`) and is DELIBERATELY NOT part of `ReceiptBody` / the leaf; it is
 * revealed only to authorized verifiers for selective disclosure.
